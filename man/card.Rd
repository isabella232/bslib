\usage{
card(..., class = NULL, width = NULL, height = NULL, autowrap = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named arguments become attributes on the \verb{<div class="card">}
element. Unnamed arguments become card items, and can be any valid child of
an \link[htmltools:builder]{htmltools tag}.}

\item{class}{Additional CSS classes to include on the card div.}

\item{width, height}{Any valid \link[htmltools:validateCssUnit]{CSS unit}; for
example, \code{height="100\%"}.}

\item{autowrap}{The Bootstrap card is designed to contain only a few specific
types of elements: \code{div.card-header}, \code{div.card-body}, etc. If \code{autowrap}
is \code{TRUE}, any unnamed arguments to \code{card()} are checked to see if they are
known card items (like \code{\link[=card_header]{card_header()}}, \code{\link[=card_plot]{card_plot()}}, etc.) and if not,
they are automatically wrapped in \code{\link[=card_body]{card_body()}}. If \code{autowrap} is \code{FALSE},
then all unnamed arguments are nested directly within the card element with
no further processing.}

\description{
Cards are general purpose containers for grouping UI elements
together inside of a simple border. A basic card might just have a title
and a plot, while a complicated one might contain an image, title,
subtitle, text, button, and a footer.

Cards are often arranged in a row or grid, with every card in a row having
the same height. To facilitate this, the \code{card()} and \verb{card_*()} family of
functions have options for specifying the vertical stretching behavior of
card items.
